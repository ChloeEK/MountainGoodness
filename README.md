# MountainGoodness

I approached a small local business called Mountain Goodness in Revelstoke. It is a health food store that has a rewards program for every dollar you spend on supplements. If you spend $200 in supplements, you receive $10 off your next purchase. They currently keep track of the rewards of their customers through hundreds of cue cards.
