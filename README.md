# MountainGoodness

I approached a small local business called Mountain Goodness in Revelstoke. It is a health food store that has a rewards program for every dollar you spend on supplements. If you spend $200 in supplements, you receive $10 off your next purchase. They currently keep track of the rewards of their customers through hundreds of cue cards. My proposed solution was to create a program that easily lets employees search for a customer, add the product and price of the supplement, and easily see how far away the customer is from the next reward.
